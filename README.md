## Insights
### Popular Techniques
- **Collaborative Filtering Systems:** These systems rely heavily on user behavior data to make recommendations. 
  - **Challenge:** Acquiring user behavior data can be difficult.
  
### Alternative Approaches
- **Content-Based Techniques:**
  - **Item-Item Collaborative Filtering:** This method only requires content data, making it suitable when user behavior data is unavailable.
- **Synthetic User Behavior Data:**
  - **Generating Data:** Another approach is to generate synthetic user behavior data from available content data.
