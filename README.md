# Content Recommendation System
This project focuses on studying content recommendation systems. Some datasets are very large, so they are not uploaded to GitHub. Use the following [link](https://github.com/tonyctyy/content-recommendation/archive/master.zip) to download the main branch of the repository.

## Folder Structure
### data
It includes 3 folders (`processed_datasets`, `raw_datasets`, and `zipped_datasets`) to store different types of datasets. 

### docs
It includes all the documentations and required information for the project.

### logs
It includes all logs related to the project (e.g., dataset information, tutorials, etc.) are stored in the [logs](./logs/README.md) folder. Check the logs for more details.

### src
It includes the source code for the project. The `src` folder will be further divided into the following subfolders:
 - `data_ processing`: Contains scripts for data processing.
 - `modeling`: Contains scripts for building and training models.
 - `backend`: Contains scripts for the backend server.
 - `frontend`: Contains scripts for the frontend application.

## Instructions
We will use the `pipenv` package manager to manage dependencies. To install `pipenv`, run the following command:
```bash
pip install pipenv
```

To install the dependencies, run the following command (make sure you are in the project directory where the `Pipfile` is located):
```bash
pipenv install
```

<h4> Tip: When you want to read a large files, you can use the `chunksize` parameter in `pandas.read_csv()` or `pandas.read_json()` to read the file in chunks. This can help you avoid memory issues. </h4>

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js (Alternative: Tailwind CSS)
- **Backend**: Flask.py (Algorithm Implementation: Sklearn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- **Database**: TBC
- **Deployment**: AWS/Azure (TBC)

## Summary (updated on 6/9/2024)
The following summary is based on material from the [Red Content Recommendation System Tutorial](logs/RedRS_tutorial/RedRS_tutorial.md). Check it for a comprehensive overview.

### Content Recommendation System
The Content Recommendation System includes several stages:
1. **Retrieval** (reduces results from trillions to thousands)
   - Typically combines different methods (e.g., Collaborative Filtering, GNN) to retrieve results and aggregate them.

2. **Pre-Ranking** (reduces results from thousands to hundreds)
   - Neural networks are used here to predict evaluation metrics (e.g., click-through rate, like rate).

3. **Ranking** (a more complex mechanism for ranking results compared to pre-ranking)

4. **Re-Ranking** (reduces results from hundreds to tens)
   - Considers both scores and variety of the results, setting rules to redistribute similar results.
   - Uses different sampling methods (e.g., MMR, DPP) to reduce results.
   - Adds advertisements and additional information to the results.

### Popular Techniques
- **Collaborative Filtering (CF):** A widely used model in the retrieval stage. Common applications include **Item CF** and **User CF**. CF can be used to construct multiple channels to retrieve related content effectively.
  - **Challenges:**
    - Difficulty in finding user behavior data in open-source datasets.
      1. **Item-Item Collaborative Filtering:** This method only requires content data, making it suitable when user behavior data is unavailable.
      2. **Synthetic User Behavior Data:** Another approach is to generate synthetic user behavior data from available content data (i.e., simulation data that maintains the original properties).
    - Many null data points exist when considering millions of items and users (e.g., User Rating to Movies Matrix).

- **Deep Structured Semantic Model (DSSM):** Another widely used model in the retrieval stage. DSSM is a neural network model that uses a pairwise loss function to learn the similarity between two items.
