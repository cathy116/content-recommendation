# 28/6/2024: Pre-Meeting Brainstorm

Can we have multiple research directions and findings? (Or should we?) The following directions are from Perplexity.

## 1. Zero-shot or Few-shot Learning for Recommendations (i.e., **Cold-Start** Scenario)

**Research Question:** How can we effectively recommend content to new users or for new items with minimal historical data?

**Direction:** Investigate techniques that can generalize from limited data to make recommendations in cold-start scenarios. This could involve:
- Developing models that can transfer knowledge from existing users/items to new ones
- Exploring meta-learning approaches for quick adaptation to new users or items
- Utilizing external knowledge bases or pre-trained language models to enhance recommendations with minimal data

**My Opinion:** We must address the issue of cold-start. Therefore, regardless of our focus, we should prioritize cold-start scenarios.

## 2. Multi-Modal Content Analysis for Recommendations

**Research Question:** How can we integrate multiple types of content data (text, images, audio, video) to improve recommendation accuracy?

**Direction:** Develop models that can process and combine different types of content data to create more comprehensive item representations. This could include:
- Designing fusion techniques for different data modalities
- Exploring cross-modal learning to leverage relationships between different types of content
- Investigating how multi-modal analysis can improve recommendation explanations

**My Opinion:** If we consider multiple media types, it will involve a lot of knowledge that may not be directly related to CRS but is worth studying. For example, we can perform sentiment analysis for comments, feature extraction for images, etc. This will allow us to explore more machine learning models useful in other areas.

## 3. Temporal Dynamics in Content Recommendation

**Research Question:** How can we effectively model and utilize temporal patterns in content consumption for more accurate recommendations?

**Direction:** Explore ways to incorporate time-based patterns and trends into recommendation models. This could involve:
- Developing time-aware recommendation algorithms
- Investigating methods to capture both short-term and long-term user interests
- Exploring techniques to handle concept drift in user preferences over time

**My Opinion:** In short, it involves developing a model that considers time in terms of short-term and long-term user behavior. Although this is difficult to achieve, it is important to consider.

## 4. Fairness and Bias Mitigation in Recommendations

**Research Question:** How can we ensure fairness and mitigate biases in content recommendation systems, especially with limited user data?

**Direction:** Investigate techniques to identify and mitigate biases in recommendations. This could include:
- Developing fairness-aware recommendation algorithms
- Exploring methods to balance personalization and diversity in recommendations
- Investigating the impact of data limitations on fairness and proposing mitigation strategies

**My Opinion:** I'm unsure if there is any existing theory or concept addressing this. Moreover, I don't think it is the most critical issue for us to discuss.

## 5. Explainable Recommendations with Limited User Data

**Research Question:** How can we generate meaningful explanations for recommendations when user preference data is limited?

**Direction:** Explore techniques to provide transparent and interpretable recommendations. This could involve:
- Developing content-based explanation methods that don't rely heavily on user history
- Investigating how to leverage external knowledge sources for generating explanations
- Exploring visual or interactive explanation techniques for recommendations

**My Opinion:** This is more relevant to our dataset. If we have a dataset with user behavior data, we can use it to generate explanations, making it less problematic. If the user data is limited, we should study content recommendation models/techniques that don't depend on user history.

## 6. Privacy-Preserving Content Recommendation

**Research Question:** How can we develop effective recommendation systems that protect user privacy, especially when working with sensitive or limited data?

**Direction:** Investigate privacy-preserving techniques for content recommendation. This could include:
- Exploring federated learning approaches for distributed recommendation systems
- Developing differential privacy techniques for recommendation algorithms
- Investigating the trade-offs between privacy, utility, and recommendation accuracy

**My Opinion:** I don't think it is that important.
