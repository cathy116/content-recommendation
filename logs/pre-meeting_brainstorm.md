# 28/6/2024: Pre-Meeting Brainstorm
Can we have multiple research directions and findings? (Or Should We?) The following directions are from Perplexity.

## 1. Zero-shot or Few-shot Learning for Recommendations (i.e. **Cold-Start** Scenario)

Research Question: How can we effectively recommend content to new users or for new items with minimal historical data?

Direction: Investigate techniques that can generalize from limited data to make recommendations in cold-start scenarios. This could involve:
- Developing models that can transfer knowledge from existing users/items to new ones
- Exploring meta-learning approaches for quick adaptation to new users or items
- Utilizing external knowledge bases or pre-trained language models to enhance recommendations with minimal data

My Opinion: In fact, we must face the issue of cold-start so I think no matter what we do, we should have focus on cold-start.


## 2. Multi-Modal Content Analysis for Recommendations

Research Question: How can we integrate multiple types of content data (text, images, audio, video) to improve recommendation accuracy?

Direction: Develop models that can process and combine different types of content data to create more comprehensive item representations. This could include:
- Designing fusion techniques for different data modalities
- Exploring cross-modal learning to leverage relationships between different types of content
- Investigating how multi-modal analysis can improve recommendation explanations

My Opinion: If we consider multi-media type, then it will include a lot of knowledge which may not be directly related to CRS but they are worth to study. For example, we can have sentiment analysis for comments, features extraction for images, etc. Then, we can study more machine learning models that are useful in other areas.


## 3. Temporal Dynamics in Content Recommendation

Research Question: How can we effectively model and utilize temporal patterns in content consumption for more accurate recommendations?

Direction: Explore ways to incorporate time-based patterns and trends into recommendation models. This could involve:
- Developing time-aware recommendation algorithms
- Investigating methods to capture both short-term and long-term user interests
- Exploring techniques to handle concept drift in user preferences over time

My Opinion: In short, it is to develop a model that also consider time in terms of the short-term and long-term user behavior. I think this is too difficult to be done but we should consider it as well.


## 4. Fairness and Bias Mitigation in Recommendations

Research Question: How can we ensure fairness and mitigate biases in content recommendation systems, especially with limited user data?

Direction: Investigate techniques to identify and mitigate biases in recommendations. This could include:
- Developing fairness-aware recommendation algorithms
- Exploring methods to balance between personalization and diversity in recommendations
- Investigating the impact of data limitations on fairness and proposing mitigation strategies

My Opinion: I am not sure if there is any theory or existing concept working on this. Also, I think this is not the most important issue that we should discuss.


## 5. Explainable Recommendations with Limited User Data

Research Question: How can we generate meaningful explanations for recommendations when user preference data is limited?

Direction: Explore techniques to provide transparent and interpretable recommendations. This could involve:
- Developing content-based explanation methods that don't rely heavily on user history
- Investigating how to leverage external knowledge sources for generating explanations
- Exploring visual or interactive explanation techniques for recommendations

My Opinion: This is more related to our dataset. If we have a dataset with user behavior data, then we can use it to generate explanations and this will not be a problem. If the user data is limited, then we  should study the content recommendation model/technique that doesn't depend on user history.


## 6. Privacy-Preserving Content Recommendation

Research Question: How can we develop effective recommendation systems that protect user privacy, especially when working with sensitive or limited data?

Direction: Investigate privacy-preserving techniques for content recommendation. This could include:
- Exploring federated learning approaches for distributed recommendation systems
- Developing differential privacy techniques for recommendation algorithms
- Investigating the trade-offs between privacy, utility, and recommendation accuracy

These research directions offer opportunities to contribute novel insights and methodologies to the field of content recommendation, particularly in scenarios with limited user preference data. Remember to conduct a thorough literature review to identify gaps in current research and to formulate specific, testable hypotheses for your chosen direction.

My Opinion: I don't think it is that important.
