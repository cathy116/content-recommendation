## Tutorials
### [TensorFlow Official Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BthUPVwA59s&list=PLQY2H8rRoyvy2MiyUBz5RWZr5MPFkV3qz&index=2)
This series of videos provides an overview of content recommendation systems and how to build them using TensorFlow.

**Summary**: [18/6/2024: TensorFlow Tutorial](./tensorflow_tutorial.md)

### [Content Recommendation System Tutorial from Red Algorithm Engineer](https://youtu.be/5dTOPen28ts?si=qhYBTACSpeeFZXqk)
This series of videos uses Red as an example to explain content recommendation systems. It's in Chinese, and I've used a lot of information from here for the summary.

**Summary**: [5/7/2024: Red Content Recommendation System Tutorial](./RedRS_tutorial/RedRS_tutorial.md)

### [FunRec](https://github.com/datawhalechina/fun-rec?tab=readme-ov-file)
This GitHub repo is a Chinese study resource for content recommendation systems. I haven't checked the details yet.

## Dataset
### [Yelp Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/main)
Yelp is a platform for users to find, review, and recommend businesses in different categories (e.g., food, shopping, entertainment, etc.) across 8 metropolitan areas in the USA and Canada. This dataset is originally used for the Yelp Challenge and is open for academic research.
